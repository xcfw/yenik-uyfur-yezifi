## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm, desaturated brown (#B8BB26), reminiscent of natural tones found in mocha, creates a comforting and familiar feel.
- Background color: A very dark desaturated grayish-blue (#232634), aligns to a dark color scheme in the style of the Catppuccin Mocha palette.
- Accent color: A muted reddish-orange (#D3869B), complements the primary color and adds a subtle highlight to interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- GitHub-like interface with clear, sectioned layout for input, output, settings, and history.
